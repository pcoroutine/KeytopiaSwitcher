# KeytopiaSwitcher

KeytopiaSwitcher is an unofficial hosts switcher for the PS Keytopia, with simple clicks between 2 buttons you can choose between playing normal GT or the PS, 
made in C#, the application is fast and has a small file size.

KeytopiaSwitcher is made with the focus on being compatible with the Windows OS.

KeytopiaSwitcher will not have any updates unless I for some reason feel like updating the UI/code or Keytopia has changed their VPS and I need to change what 
the hosts file needs to change to.
